Team 14's MSBA AI Final Project: Reinforcement Learning

The U.S. generates about 119 billion pounds of food waste each year, which is roughly 40% of all food produced in the country. This amounts to about 130 billion meals and nearly $408 billion worth of food thrown away annually. This waste contributes significantly to environmental issues, including methane emissions from landfills, wasted water, and unnecessary energy consumption. What if we could use reinforcement learning to create a dynamic pricing strategy to help grocery retailers reduce food waste, while still maximizing their profits? We think that perishable goods from the perspective of a grocery retailer is a perfect example of how reinforcement learning can be used. This is a process that benefits all involved as customers can get better discounts, stores don't have wasted products, and there is no food waste which has an economic and environmental impact. We created a code demonstration to show how reinforcement learning can practically work. For a more hands-on example, we also created an interactive website where the user can input certain fields, like shelf like and starting price, and it can calculate the appropriate price discounts to meet the demand level and sell all stock before it goes to waste.
