Team 14's MSBA AI Final Project: Reinforcement Learning

The U.S. generates about 119 billion pounds of food waste each year, which is roughly 40% of all food produced in the country. This amounts to about 130 billion meals and nearly $408 billion worth of food thrown away annually. This waste contributes significantly to environmental issues, including methane emissions from landfills, wasted water, and unnecessary energy consumption. What if we could use reinforcement learning to create a dynamic pricing strategy to help grocery retailers reduce their food waste, while still maximizing their profits. We think that perishable goods from the perespctive of a grocery retailer is a perfect example of how reinforcement learning can be used.
